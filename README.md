# PHY210M - Thermal Physics
Course offered at IITK by Dr Koushik Pal in the Spring Semester of 2025.

Primary Reference Material: Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics by Herbert B. Callen

Course requires some background with partial derivatives and methods to manipulate them. Although, rigorous proofs of the same are not necessary, basic understanding of the rules is necessary because manipulations of partial derivatives is a major component of thermal physics. For this I'd recommend going through the following resources before studying the Fundamental Equations:
- https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~jdg/AECHAIN.PDF
- https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/chainrule.aspx
- https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Calculus/Calculus_(OpenStax)/14%3A_Differentiation_of_Functions_of_Several_Variables/14.05%3A_The_Chain_Rule_for_Multivariable_Functions

The theory part of the course is pretty light, just some derivative manipulations and conversion of systems into their mathematical formulations and solving them. But this course requires an intense amount of practice to be able to solve questions in the examination. Solid theoretcial understanding but lack of practice will likely lead to either you getting stuck with some derivative because you've not seen anything of that sort before, or you missing something while converting the physical system into it's mathematical formulation, or in the worst case scenario you running out of time (you'll have to solve a decent number of questions 2 hours if the course structure remains the same)

In-text questions of Callen are one of the best resources for practice, but if you want to work in a targeted manner, I've pushed the homework and tutorial problems (although without solutions). For previous year questions of assignments and examinations, following resource repository by Saad is a great resource (this one has solutions as well):

In case the drive gets deleted, I've also uploaded a compressed version of the same to this repository.
